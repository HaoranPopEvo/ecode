Description: A framework to simulate ecosystem dynamics through ordinary differential equations (ODEs). 
    You create an ODE model, tells 'ecode' to explore its behaviour, and perform numerical 
    simulations on the model. 'ecode' also allows you to fit model parameters by machine learning 
    algorithms. Potential users include researchers who are interested in the dynamics of ecological 
    community and biogeochemical cycles.
